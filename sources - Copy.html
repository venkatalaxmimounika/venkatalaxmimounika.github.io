            <h3>HTML</h3>
            </br>
            <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML.
                Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in 
                collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version of HTML, HTML5
            </p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            </br>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
                    language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
                    World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                </p>
            </br>
                <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
            </br>
                <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies
                    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the 
                    client side for webpage behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers 
                    have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                </p>
            </br>
            <h3>SVG</h3>
            </br>
            <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support 
            for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
            since 1999.
            </p>
            </br>
            <h3>JQUERY</h3>
            </br>
            <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, 
                CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of Aug 2022, jQuery is used 
                by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>I am very greatful to each and every one who involved in designing and development phase of all technologies used in preparation of
                this website.
