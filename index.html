                    <p>I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science department at UIC. Also, working as a Teaching Assistant
                    for the subject CS112 (Program Desing I in the Context of Biological Problems). Before this job, I worked as
                    a Research Assistant in a project Smart Environmental Management Systems for Improving Occupants Comfort and

                     I want to be a Data Analyst/Scientist in future. This course helps me in fulfilling my dream as a good visualization
                     explains every thing about the data, which is very important for any company. My hobbies include dancing, watching
                     series, and hanging out with friends. My professors and coworkers often compliment me on being
                     proactive in both my academic and professional pursuits. I bring the right analytical, creative
                     thinking, and problem-solving talents to the table while working on academic, extracurricular, or
                     professional tasks.
