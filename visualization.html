                    <p>This visualization gives information about the reduction in Infant mortality rate since 1990. I like this
                        visualization because it clearly displays how many children are saved in some areas: East Asia and Pacific, 
                        Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-saharan Africa.
                        Also, it mentions the reasons related to health and education,which helped to reduce the death rate of children 
                        below the age of 5. 
                       </br>
                       </br>
                        The reason that I like the visualization is every one can understand what the author wants to convey. Starting
                        from color selection to show the variation in every place to the display of reasons, everything is clearly
                        understandable. Also, the visualization mentions the count of death rate.
