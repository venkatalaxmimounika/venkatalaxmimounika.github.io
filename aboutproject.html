    <h2>Black hat visualization details</h2>
    <p>In my black hat visualization, the background and the foreground color combination are very bad. Also, we can not differentiate the bubbles on the east side of the graph. So, it is impossible to get any information from the data. The legend is misleading and is not properly formatted. The colors in the graph are yellow, black, and grey. But the legend is showing blue for males and red for females. The big bubble should represent the more number of deaths and vice versa. But it is showing the opposite. The title is not properly formatted and the content of the title is not apt. Here, the graph shows death information in the USA. Either we have to make a comparison between the deaths in states or between the gender. But the title is asking about why numerous deaths are happening in the USA. We don't have any data to support this. There might be some countries exist that have more deaths than the USA. To put it in a nutshell, it is impossible to get any information from this visualization.</p>

    <h2>White hat visualization details</h2>
    <p>

        In my white hat visualization, I have taken care of all the flaws mentioned above. The color combination I picked is very good for observing every minute detail. I have given three maps with three different kinds of information and replaced the circles with spikes instead because the circles in the blackhat were overlapping each other and by using spikes, we can easily see the number of deaths per city. The first map shows the total number of deaths in every city. Also, people can see the information by hovering on the map. The second map shows the information about the males' death in every state and the male deaths are shown by using the bars. In the third graph, I have used choropleth: dark-colored states represent the state where older people died, and light colors for the states which have younger people's deaths. The legend on every page is clear and informative. </p>
